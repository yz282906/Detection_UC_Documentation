  "goal": "a short, plaintext description of the type of behavior the ADS is supposed to detect.",
  "categorization": "a mapping of the ADS to the relevant entry in the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) Framework. ATT&CK provides a language for various post-exploitation techniques and strategies that adversaries might use.",
  "strategy_abstract": "a high-level walkthrough of how the ADS functions. This describes what the alert is looking for, what technical data sources are used, any enrichment that occurs, and any false positive minimization steps",
  "technical_context": "provides detailed information and background needed for a responder to understand all components of the alert. This should appropriately link to any platform or tooling knowledge and should include information about the direct aspects of the alert. The goal of the Technical Context section is to provide a self-contained reference for a responder to make a judgement call on any potential alert, even if they do not have direct subject matter expertise on the ADS itself",
  "blind_spots_assumptions": "recognized issues, assumptions, and areas where an ADS may not fire. No ADS is perfect and identifying assumptions and blind spots can help other engineers understand how an ADS may fail to fire or be defeated by an adversary",
  "false_positives": "known instances of an ADS misfiring due to a misconfiguration, idiosyncrasy in the environment, or other non-malicious scenario. These false positive alerts should be suppressed within the Security Information and Event Management tool (SIEM) to prevent alert generation when a known false positive event occurs",
  "validation": "the steps required to generate a representative true positive event which triggers this alert. This is similar to a unit test and describes how an engineer can cause the ADS to fire. This can be a walkthrough of steps used to generate an alert, a script to trigger the ADS (such as Red Canaryâ€™s Atomic Red Team Tests), or a scenario used in an alert testing and orchestration platform",
  "priority": "the various alerting levels that an ADS may be tagged with. While the alert itself should reflect the priority when it is fired through configuration in your SIEM (e.g., High, Medium, Low), this section details the criteria for the specific priorities",
  "responses": "the various alerting levels that an ADS may be tagged with. While the alert itself should reflect the priority when it is fired through configuration in your SIEM (e.g., High, Medium, Low), this section details the criteria for the specific priorities",
  "additional_resources": "internal, external, or technical references that may be useful for understanding the ADS"
